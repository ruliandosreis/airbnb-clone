This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```
You'll also need a .env file to configure the keys used in the project. They are:
```
DATABASE_URL
NEXTAUTH_SECRET
GITHUB_ID
GITHUB_SECRET
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME
```

Then, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Technologies

This project was developed using the newest features using the following tecnologies:

- React.js (Next.js)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Prisma
- MongoDB
- Cloudinary

## The Project Itself

The idea is a [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com.br/) clone, a service that lets property owners rent out their spaces to travelers looking for a place to stay, with some changes of my own.

The authentication, listing, booking and other features are all linked with a database created in MongoDB, allied with prisma for the communication and schema creation.

Some features such as testing, documentation, performance checks and accessibility were not taken into account, as this is a project inspired by another, but they are important resources in the development of a website and definitely valued by me.
